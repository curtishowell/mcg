				Although projects range from 6 to 12 weeks, they typically follow a similar work flow. First, the scope and time frame of the project is set with the partners. Soon after, a launch meeting is held including the entire project team (4-5 students). This meeting details the engagement's milestones and determines the best form of communication with the team. Throughout the project there are typically 2-3 milestone meetings. Sometime during this period the partners have a midpoint evaluation meeting to allow both the client and team to provide feedback to each other. The project culminates in the team's presentation of their findings and recommendations in a boardroom setting.
